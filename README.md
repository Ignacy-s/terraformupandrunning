# Terraform Up & Running Learning Project

This repository contains my notes, documentation, and code examples
while I learn Terraform using the book [Terraform: Up &
Running](https://www.terraformupandrunning.com/) by Yevgeniy Brikman.

## Overview

The purpose of this project is to learn how to write infrastructure as
code using Terraform, a popular tool for provisioning and managing
cloud resources. This repository will serve as a reference for
concepts and code examples from the book as I progress through it.

## Acknowledgments

- [Yevgeniy Brikman](https://github.com/brikis98) for writing
  [Terraform: Up & Running](https://www.terraformupandrunning.com/),
  an excellent resource for learning Terraform.
